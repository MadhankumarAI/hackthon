    "Based on the provided context, the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the waiting period for PED is not specified in the provided context.\n\nThe context only mentions the waiting periods for specific diseases/procedures, which are:\n\n* 90 days for lifestyle conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, and Cardiac conditions\n* 1 year for Benign ENT disorders, Tonsillectomy, Adenoidectomy, Mastoidectomy, and Tympanoplasty\n* 2 years and 3 years for unspecified diseases/procedures\n\nThere is no mention of a specific waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) in general. However, it is mentioned in point c) of Context 1 that if any of the specified diseases/procedures falls under the waiting period specified for Pre-Existing Diseases, then the longer of the two waiting periods shall apply. This implies that there is a waiting period for PED, but it is not specified in the provided context.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is not specified in the provided context.",
    "Based on the provided context, the policy does cover maternity expenses, but with certain conditions and exclusions.\n\n**Coverage:**\n\nThe policy covers maternity expenses, which include:\n\n* Medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections incurred during hospitalization)\n* Expenses towards lawful medical termination of pregnancy during the policy period\n\n**Conditions:**\n\n* The covered female insured person must be between 18 and 45 years of age\n* The maternity expenses must be incurred after a waiting period of 24 months\n\n**Exclusions:**\n\n* The company shall not be liable to make any payment under the cover in respect of maternity expenses incurred in connection with or in respect of:\n\t+ Covered female insured persons below 18 years and above 45 years of age\n\t+ Delivery or termination within a waiting period of 24 months\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The New Born Baby is automatically covered from birth under the sum insured available to the mother during the corresponding policy period, for up to 3 months of age. After attaining 3 months of age, the New Born Baby shall be covered only if specifically included in the policy mid-term and requisite premium paid to the company.\n\nIn summary, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment and lawful medical termination of pregnancy, but with specific conditions and exclusions related to the age of the insured person and waiting period.",
    "Based on the provided context, I will analyze the question and provide a precise answer.\n\nThe question asks about the waiting period for cataract surgery. However, upon reviewing the provided context, I notice that cataract surgery is not explicitly mentioned in either Context 1 or Context 2.\n\nRefractive error of the eye with more than 7.5 dioptres is mentioned in Context 1, but it does not specifically mention cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is a treatment for a specific type of refractive error, but it is not explicitly listed.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the waiting period for cataract surgery is not specified in the provided context. If the policyholder is seeking information on the waiting period for cataract surgery, they would need to refer to other sections of the policy document or contact the insurance provider directly for clarification.\n\nIn summary, the waiting period for cataract surgery is not available in the provided context.",
    "Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is: YES, the medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy, but with certain conditions and exclusions.\n\nAccording to Context 2, Section 7, \"Organ Donor's Medical Expenses\", the Company shall indemnify the Medical Expenses incurred in respect of an organ donor's Hospitalisation during the Policy Period, provided that:\n\n* The organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 (and its amendments from time to time).\n* The organ is used for an Insured Person and the Insured Person has been medically advised to undergo an organ transplant.\n* The Medical Expenses shall be incurred in respect of the organ donor as an in-patient in a Hospital Claim has been admitted under In-patient Treatment Section in respect of the Insured Person undergoing the organ transplant.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that there are exclusions to this coverage, as mentioned in Context 1. The Company shall not be liable to make payment for any claim under this Cover which arises for or in connection with any of the following:\n\n* Pre-hospitalization Medical Expenses or Post- Hospitalization Medical Expenses of the organ donor.\n* Costs directly or indirectly associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ.\n* Medical Expenses where the organ transplant is experimental or investigational.\n* Any medical treatment or complication in respect of the donor, consequent to harvesting.\n* Any expenses related to organ transportation or preservation.\n\nTherefore, the medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy, but only if the conditions mentioned in Context 2 are met, and the expenses do not fall under the exclusions listed in Context 1.",
    "Based on the provided context, the No Claim Discount (NCD) offered in this policy is as follows:\n\n**For policies with a term of one year:**\nA flat 5% NCD shall be allowed on the base premium, provided no claims are reported in the expiring policy.\n\n**For policies with a term exceeding one year:**\nThe NCD amount with respect to each claim-free policy year shall be aggregated and allowed on renewal. The aggregate amount of NCD allowed shall not exceed a flat 5% of the total base premium for the term of the policy.\n\nIn summary, the NCD offered in this policy is a flat 5% discount on the base premium, with the condition that no claims are reported in the expiring policy for policies with a term of one year, and an aggregated discount not exceeding 5% of the total base premium for policies with a term exceeding one year.",
    "Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:\n\nYES, there is a benefit for preventive health check-ups.\n\nAccording to Context 1, Section 2, \"Expenses of health check up shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the Policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break.\" This indicates that the policy provides a benefit for preventive health check-ups, which will be reimbursed at the end of every two continuous policy years, subject to the policy being continuously renewed without any break.\n\nIt is important to note that this benefit is not affected by any exclusions mentioned in the policy, including pre-existing diseases, as the reimbursement is for a preventive health check-up and not for the treatment of any disease or condition.",
    "Based on the provided context, the policy defines a 'Hospital' as any hospital/nursing home that meets the following criteria:\n\n* Has qualified nursing staff under its employment round the clock;\n* Has at least ten inpatient beds in towns with a population of less than ten lacs and fifteen inpatient beds in all other places;\n* Has qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock;\n* Has a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out;\n* Maintains daily records of patients and makes these accessible to the Company's authorized personnel.\n\nThis definition is derived from Context 1, which outlines the requirements for a hospital/nursing home to be eligible for reimbursement under the policy.",

    "Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine if there are sub-limits on room rent and ICU charges for Plan A. The context does not provide specific information about the sub-limits for room rent and ICU charges for Plan A, and the available information only mentions benefits and definitions related to ambulance charges, air ambulance, medical emergency reunion, and room rent and surgery/surgical procedure. While there may be an overall limit on benefits, as suggested by the context, further review of the entire policy document, including Annexure-II, would be necessary to provide a definitive answer."
